# InstUnsubs

This script uses the Instagram API to retrieve the list of accounts you're subscribed to and the list of accounts that subscribe to you. It then calculates and displays the list of accounts that you're subscribed to but they're not subscribed back to you.

The script uses the `requests` library to make API requests to the Instagram API and the `python-dotenv` library to securely store the Instagram API access token. The access token is stored in an environment variable defined in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

Before running the script, make sure you have the required libraries installed and replace the placeholders in the `.env` file with your actual Instagram API access token(see .env.example).
